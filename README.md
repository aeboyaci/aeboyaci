## About Me:

I am a Software Engineer currently residing in Ankara, Turkey. I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn new technologies and enhance my skills. In my professional career, I have gained extensive experience working with backend development and I have a particular fondness for using Go for backend development, while JavaScript, along with libraries like React and frameworks such as NextJS, are my go-to tools for frontend work. I am currently working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases, and I am very enthusiastic about leveraging these technologies in my projects.

Since my high school years, I have been passionate about Software Engineering. This early interest drove me to actively seek out opportunities to learn and grow in this field. My journey with programming has been a significant part of my life, and it truly took off during my B.S. in Computer Engineering at TOBB University of Economics and Technology, where my passion for programming was ignited.

Throughout university and my career, I have dedicated myself to honing my skills in Software Engineering. I actively participate in workshops, training sessions, and professional events to build a strong foundation and continuously expand my expertise. My ultimate goal is to become an expert in this field, and I am committed to continuously improving and expanding my skill set.

I look forward to continuing my journey in the tech industry, learning new things, and contributing to the world of technology.
