## About Me:

I am a Senior Computer Science student at TOBB University of Economics and Technology, currently residing in Ankara, Turkey. As a backend developer, I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities. I have a deep interest in learning new technologies and constantly strive to enhance my skills.

My journey with programming has been a significant part of my life. I started with languages like Go, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. My passion for programming was ignited during my B.S. in Computer Science.

In my professional career and everyday life, I use Go, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I have a particular fondness for Go for backend development. JavaScript and its libraries like React, along with NextJS, are usually my go-to for front-end work. I am currently working with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases and am very enthusiastic about it.

Since my high school years, I have been passionate about Cyber Security and Software Engineering. I have dedicated myself to honing my skills and knowledge in these fields. Through actively participating in workshops, trainings, and professional events, I have built a strong foundation and taken on responsibilities to further enhance my expertise. My ultimate goal is to become an expert in Cyber Security and Software Engineering by continuously improving and expanding my skill set.

I look forward to continuing my journey, learning, and contributing to the world of technology.
