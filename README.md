## About Me:
I’m a backend software engineer who loves building scalable, reliable systems that actually make an impact. Right now, I’m working at Midas, where I design trading systems for millions of users on Borsa İstanbul. Most of my daily work involves Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis and lots of problem-solving around low-latency, high-throughput systems.

Before that, I was at Picus Security, working with Go and PostgreSQL on breach & attack simulation platforms. I’ve also had stints in cybersecurity research at STM and defense tech at Baykar, where I picked up a bunch of fun (and challenging) experiences.

Outside of work, I love hackathons and side projects — from building a malware generation platform with Go + React (🏆 1st place) to AR navigation for airports and VR training tools.
Tech I enjoy: Java, Go, Python, C++, JS, and tools like Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL. Always curious, always learning, and always up for a new challenge. 🚀
